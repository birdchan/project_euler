Number letter counts
Problem 17
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?


NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

# rules regarding the British numbers

http://www.vocabulix.com/grammar/english-numbers.shtml

Basic rules for building English numbers: 
- The numbers 0 to 19 are written in one word 
- 11 and 12 are exceptions: "eleven" and "twelve" 
- Numbers 20 to 99: the unit's digit (right-most digit) and the decimal digit (second digit from right) are connected by a hyphen (i.e. twenty-one) 
- Numbers 20 to 90: if the unit's digit is "cero" it is not written ("twenty" and not "twenty-zero") 
- Prior to "hundred" the numbers "one" to "nine" are written as separate words without a hyphen 
- "Hundred" is always in the singular form ("five hundred" not "five-hundreds")
- Prior to "thousand" the numbers 1 to 999 are written as seperate words. "Thousand" always in singular form. 
- In British notation for numbers between 101 to 999 an "and" is placed prior to the last word ("three hundred and forty-five"). 
- One million is written without hyphen and in singular form ("five million" not "five-millions") 

P.S. check spelling... I had 90 as ninty... also the "and" rule
